# BANKING-APPLICATION
I have made one of my first Java mini projects today.It is a Banking Application project that accepts the name and customer id of the user and displays a menu that contains 5 options for the user to choose from.
Menu contains the following options:
1.Balance: To check the balance in the account.
2.Deposit: To deposit money in the account.
3.Withdraw: To withdraw a certain amount from the account.
4. PastTransaction: To display the latest and most recent transaction status.
5. Exit
I have made use of basic concepts of switch case,if else statements,functions,constructors and intance variables in the project.
